### What I learned

I learned about light color palletes that look very good as backgroud of a div. Making a website responsive so that it can be viewed in all devices. This is the beginning for me of making websites responsive.


### Continued development

Making websites responsive in a way that navbar can have different function while in desktop mode and different function in mobile screen.
I want to learn more about media queries.
