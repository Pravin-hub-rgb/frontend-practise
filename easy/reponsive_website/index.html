                Education beganin prehistory, as adults trained the yound in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of Middle Kingdom.
